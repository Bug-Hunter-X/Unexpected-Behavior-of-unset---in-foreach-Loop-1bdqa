This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to using `unset()` within a `foreach` loop that iterates over an array.  The code in `bug.php` showcases this issue.  The solution in `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected approach that avoids the problematic behavior.  The problem arises because modifying the array's internal pointer during iteration causes elements to be skipped.  The solution demonstrates safe ways to handle array modification within loops.
